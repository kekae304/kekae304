**My Projects:** 
- **Spatial Mapping Using Time-of-Flight:**
  -  Developed an efficient and cost-effective 3D scanning solution that performs distance measurements at every 11.25Â° of a full 360Â° rotation.
  -  Utilized a microcontroller to manage operations, a stepper motor for rotational movement, and a time-of-flight sensor to record distance data.
  -  Implemented the time-of-flight sensor to measure distances by emitting and receiving an infrared beam, calculating the distance based on the time of flight.
  -  Transmitted data to the microcontroller via I2C protocol and then sent to a PC using UART protocol.
  -  Converted data into Cartesian coordinates on the PC and visualized it as a mesh-like point cloud using Pythonâ€™s Open3D library.
  
- **DC Power Supply:**
  -  Designed and engineered a precision DC power supply system aimed at delivering a consistent 10 mA at 3V Â± 0.1V output, sourced from a 120 V (rms) input at 1 kHz frequency.
  -  Innovatively used a function generator to simulate the necessary sinusoidal waveform for laboratory testing, eliminating the necessity for direct connection with the high-voltage source.
  -  Demonstrated exceptional proficiency in circuit design and implementation, ensuring the power supply system consistently met stringent output requirements.
  -  Drafted an extensive report outlining the reasoning behind the choice of input level, the specs of the transformer, and the nuances of the circuit design, demonstrating a thorough comprehension of the design procedure and testing techniques.
  
- **Snake Game:**
  - Crafted a dynamic Snake Game using fundamental programming principles and data structures in C and C++ to deliver an engaging gaming experience.
  - Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection, using C and C++.
  - Utilized fundamental programming principles to ensure efficient game logic and smooth user experience.
 
- **Stack 'N' Slice:**
  - Designed a safe, convenient, and accessible solution to help a visually impaired client easily complete the steps of making a sandwich utilizing AutoCAD.
  - Secured 2nd place among 1000 Engineering I students at McMaster University in the 1P13 Course and was endorsed by the Dyson Company serving as a testament to the innovative solution.
