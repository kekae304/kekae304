**My Projects:** 

- **DC Power Supply:**
  
  -  Designed and engineered a precision DC power supply system aimed at delivering a consistent 10 mA at 3V Â± 0.1V output, sourced from a 120 V (rms) input at 1 kHz frequency.
  -  Innovatively used a function generator to simulate the necessary sinusoidal waveform for laboratory testing, eliminating the necessity for direct connection with the high-voltage source.
  -  Demonstrated exceptional proficiency in circuit design and implementation, ensuring the power supply system consistently met stringent output requirements.
  -  Drafted an extensive report outlining the reasoning behind the choice of input level, the specs of the transformer, and the nuances of the circuit design, demonstrating a thorough comprehension of the design procedure and testing techniques.

- **NBA Stat Predictor:**
  - Designed a predictive NBA statistic model that leverages a simple artificial neural network system to generate an accurate forecast of player performance, providing valuable insights into potential outcomes. The model employs advanced algorithms to analyze data from the last 14 years to make informed predictions on player performances.
  - Developed a data scraper capable of extracting 90 000+ individual data points from 450 NBA players in less than 30 seconds. Simultaneously, organizing the extracted data in an efficient and user-friendly format for seamless readability.
  - Coded using Python within the Jupyter Notebook environment, utilizing the machine learning library, scikit-learn for model construction. Meanwhile, incorporating NumPy and Pandas libraries for data interpretation and manipulation.
  
- **Snake Game:**
  - Crafted a dynamic Snake Game using fundamental programming principles and data structures in C and C++ to deliver an engaging gaming experience.
  - Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection, using C and C++.
  - Utilized fundamental programming principles to ensure efficient game logic and smooth user experience.
 
- **Stack 'N' Slice:**
  - Designed a safe, convenient, and accessible solution to help a visually impaired client easily complete the steps of making a sandwich utilizing AutoCAD.
  - Secured 2nd place among 1000 Engineering I students at McMaster University in the 1P13 Course and was endorsed by the Dyson Company serving as a testament to the innovative solution.
