**My Projects:** 
- **Control Core:**
  -  Designed a system monitoring and media controller making use of an ESP32 micro-controller and an OLED display.
  -  Used C/C++ to integrate an ESP32 micro-controller with the display leveraging I2C/UART communication protocols.
  -  Implemented a custom graphical user interface (GUI) with dynamic button layouts and easy navigation for seamless user interaction.
    
- **Spatial Mapping Device:**
  - Developed an efficient LiDAR-powered spatial mapping device for indoor spatial mapping.
  - Used C/C++ to integrate an STM32 micro-controller with ToF sensors and I2C/UART communication protocols for accurate distance measurements and data transfer.
  - Implemented Python scripts for data visualization and performing spatial measurements.
    
- **DC Power Supply:**
  -  Designed and engineered a precision DC power supply system aimed at delivering a consistent 10 mA at 3V Â± 0.1V output, sourced from a 120 V (rms) input at 1 kHz frequency.
  -  Innovatively used a function generator to simulate the necessary sinusoidal waveform for laboratory testing, eliminating the necessity for direct connection with the high voltage source.
  -  Drafted an extensive report outlining the reasoning behind the choice of input level, the specs of the transformer, and the nuances of the circuit design, demonstrating a thorough comprehension of the design procedure and testing techniques.

- **Snake Game:**
  - Designed an 3-bit DAC using a transistor-resistor network to convert digital inputs into proportional analog voltages.
  - Determined bit weights based on full-scale voltage ratio and the number of possible digital values.
  - Implemented a resistive network with an inverting unity-gain buffer to produce precise analog output from digital inputs
  
- **Snake Game:**
  - Crafted a dynamic Snake Game using fundamental programming principles and data structures in C/C++ to deliver an engaging gaming experience.
  - Implemented core gameplay mechanics, including snake movement, food generation, and collision detection.
  - Utilized fundamental programming principles to ensure efficient game logic and smooth user experience.
